## ELinks 0.18.0 configuration file

## This is ELinks configuration file. You can edit it manually,
## if you wish so; this file is edited by ELinks when you save
## options through UI, however only option values will be altered
## and missing options will be added at the end of file; if option
## is not written in this file, but in some file included from it,
## it is NOT counted as missing. Note that all your formatting,
## own comments and so on will be kept as-is.
##
## Obviously, if you don't like what ELinks is going to do with
## this file, you can change it by altering the config.saving_style
## option. Come on, aren't we friendly guys after all?

#  Connection options.

#  SSL options.

## document.browse.forms.editor <str>
#  Path to the executable that ELinks should launch when the user requests

## protocol.http
#  HTTP-specific options.

## protocol.http.referer
#  HTTP referer sending options. HTTP referer is a special header sent in
#  the HTTP requests, which is supposed to contain the previous page visited
#  by the browser.This way, the server can know what link did you follow
#  when accessing that page. However, this behaviour can unfortunately
#  considerably affect privacy and can lead even to a security problem on
#  some badly designed web pages.

## protocol.http.referer.policy <num>
#  Mode of sending HTTP referer:
#  0 is send no referer
#  1 is send current URL as referer
#  2 is send fixed fake referer
#  3 is send previous URL as referer (correct, but insecure)
set protocol.http.referer.policy = 1

## protocol.http.compression [0|1]
#  If enabled, the capability to receive compressed content (gzip and/or
#  bzip2) is announced to the server, which usually sends the reply
#  compressed, thus saving some bandwidth at slight CPU expense.
#
#  If ELinks displays a incomplete page or garbage, try disabling this
#  option. If that helps, there may be a bug in the decompression part of
#  ELinks. Please report such bugs.
#
#  If ELinks has been compiled without compression support, this option has
#  no effect. To check the supported features, see Help -> About.
set protocol.http.compression = 1

## protocol.http.use_curl [0|1]
#  Use libcurl implementation of http(s).
set protocol.http.use_curl = 1

## ui
#  User interface options.

## ui.show_menu_bar_always [0|1]
#  Always show menu bar on the screen.
